# How does persistence work in Docker?

## First lets demonstrate how containers are stateless:


```
docker run -it busybox

echo 'some text' > file.txt'

cat file.txt

exit
```

```
docker run -it busybox

cat file.txt
```

# Docker Volumes


* Native to Docker

* Managed by the CLI

* Can be shared between containers

```
docker volume create files
docker volume inspect files
```

```
docker run -it -v files:/test busybox

cd test

echo 'some text' > file.txt

cat file.txt

exit
```

```
docker run -it -v files:/test busybox

cd test

cat file.txt
```
