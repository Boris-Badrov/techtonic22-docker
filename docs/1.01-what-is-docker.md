# What is Docker?

* A software platform for building applications based on containers 

---

# Why though?

## Portable
* Made an app and want to share it with your friend? Different versions of a dependency?
* Ensures predictability / consistency

## Composability
* Can have multiple containers talking to each other - say front end + back end + database
* Easy to swap out containers

## Isolation at the process level with its own file system
* Broke something? Only affects the container itself
* Only has what it needs to run
