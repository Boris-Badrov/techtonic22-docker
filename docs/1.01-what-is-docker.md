# What is Docker?

* A software platform for building applications based on containers 
* Imagine you have a lot of items you want to send overseas. How would you send it accounting for sizes, fragility etc?
* Containers! Which also matches up nicely with software containers.

---

# Why though?

## Portable
* Made a web app and want to share it with your friend? Different versions of a dependency?
* Ensures predictability / consistency
* No more 'oh it worked on my machine...'

## Composability
* Can have multiple containers talking to each other - say front end + back end + database
* Easy to swap out containers

## Isolation at the process level with its own file system
* Broke something? Only affects the container itself
* Only has what it needs to run

# Lets make sure everyone has Docker installed and working correctly

```
docker version
```

```
docker pull hello-world
```

#### Should receive input to indicate Docker is working correctly.
#### If you receive 'Permission Denied' on the 'pull' command then you'll need to prefix it with 'sudo'.
