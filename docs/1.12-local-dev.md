# Hot reloading within Docker

* Before the world of Docker, you probably wrote some code and executed your build directly.

* See the changes just about instantly.

* Compared to Docker, it was probably a lot faster.

* There is a way of directly editing your code within your container so you donâ€™t have to constantly rebuild.

---

# Docker mounts

* Is actually another form of persisting data within Docker.

* Allows us to choose where to mount our data.

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
     -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
     node:12-alpine \
     sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
```

## Lets break this down

```
-w /app # Sets the current directory that the command will run from.
``` 

```
-v "${pwd}:/app" # Bind mount to the current directory from the host in the container into the `/app` directory
```

* `pwd` is a Linux command that prints the current directory


```
node:12-alpine # Image to use
```


```
sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev" 
# Start a shell using `sh` then install dependencies & run the dev script.
# We are using a Node library called nodemon to accomplish the hot reloading.
```


## Lets check the logs

```
docker ps
docker logs {containerName} -f
```

Once we see `Listening on port 3000` then we are good to go - hit control + c


### Lets reverse our changes so go to `src/static/js/app.js` and update line 56 with the below content or do your own change

```
<p className="text-center">No todo items yet...</p>
```

### Refresh localhost if you have it open already and you should see the changes.

### You might get a temporary error, just refresh again

### You'll still need to build the image for future use

* The image isn't getting rebuilt each time.
* So if you restart the container without rebuilding the image, you'll lose your changes
