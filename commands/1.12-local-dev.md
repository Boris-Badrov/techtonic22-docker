# Docker mounts

* Is actually another form of persisting data within Docker.

* Allows us to choose where to mount our data.

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
     -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
     node:12-alpine \
     sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
```


## Lets check the logs

```
docker ps
docker logs {containerName} -f
```

Once we see `Listening on port 3000` then we are good to go - hit control + c


### Lets reverse our changes so go to `src/static/js/app.js` and update line 56 with the below content or do your own change

```
<p className="text-center">No todo items yet...</p>
```

### Refresh localhost if you have it open already and you should see the changes.

### You might get a temporary error, just refresh again

### You'll still need to build the image for future use

* The image isn't getting rebuilt each time.
* So if you restart the container without rebuilding the image, you'll lose your changes
