## Lets look at our current images

```
docker image ls
```
### Can see our image is not there so we need to build it first:

```
docker build -t techtonic .
```

## Lets run it

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 techtonic
```

### Lets look at the status of the new container:

```
docker ps
```

### Logs
```
docker ps # Look under NAMES to get container name
docker logs ${containerName}
```

### Finally lets go to our site! Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
