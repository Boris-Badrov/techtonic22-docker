# Docker Compose

##	Let's take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `app` directory

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

* --builds the image for us
* We don't always want to build the image, if we haven't made any code changes then we can skip building
* -d detached mode again so we can still use the terminal

### To stop your containers

```
docker-compose down
```

### Logs

```
docker-compose logs
```
