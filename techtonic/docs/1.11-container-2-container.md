# Container 2 Container Networking

* One rule: If two containers are on the same network then they can talk to each other. If they aren’t, they can’t.

* Docker allows us to create networks to allow separate containers to talk to each other via service discovery. No need to use IP addresses, a container name is all you need!

* The Docker CLI does allow us to create networks and set up containers within them but its somewhat manual and there is a much better tool included with Docker to do the job.

# Docker Compose

## Don't worry its installed by default

##	The recommended approach to setting up multiple containers.

##	Let's take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `app` directory

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

* --builds the image for us
    * We don't always want to build the image, if we haven't made any code changes then we can skip building
* -d detached mode again so we can still use the terminal

### To stop your containers

```
docker-compose down
```

### Logs

```
docker-compose logs
```
