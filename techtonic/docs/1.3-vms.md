# Rewind the clock, what was before containers? Virtual machines

### Why did virtual machines lose the battle?

* They each use their own operating system which is a heavy overhead + heavy start up / shut down costs.

* Portability issues between different host operating system due to hypervisors (creates VM’s).

* VM’s can be gigabytes in size vs Docker being in the megabytes.
