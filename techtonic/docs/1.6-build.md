## Lets look at our Dockerfile

Go to the `Dockerfile` inside the `app` directory

## Lets look at our current images

```
docker image ls
```
### Can see our image is not there so we need to build it first:

```
docker build -t techtonic .
```

* _-t_ tags the image for future reference / human readability.

* _._ means search for the Dockerfile in the current directory

## Lets run it

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 techtonic
```

* d means detached mode so we can still use the terminal
* p is port as we need to map between the port (internal to the container) to port on our machine. Without it you won't be able to access the app.


### Lets look at the status of the new container:

```
docker ps
```

### Logs

We can see the logs of an app like so:
```
docker ps # Look under NAMES to get container name
docker logs ${containerName}
```

### Finally lets go to our site! Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
